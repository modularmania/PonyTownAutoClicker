# Pony Town Auto-Clicker
> [!WARNING]
> This project is for testing / research purposes only. I do not condone any actual use of it on Pony Town's official servers.<br>

This is a simple auto-clicker for Pony Town.<br>
It is made in such a way that every movement is randomized so that it appears as realistic to a human's touch as possible.

You will need to install Tesseract here, and place the address in the code where directed: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki<br>
You are able to change values to your liking. (Screen size, messages, steps, etc.)

Happy AFKing!

# Pony Town Auto-Clicker

This is a simple auto-clicker I made one night after drinking three monsters back-to-back. <br>It is untested on Pony Town but the inputs seem to work when testing it elsewhere (ie: Notepad.)<br>
It is made in such a way that every movement is randomized so that it appears as realistic to a human's touch as possible.
